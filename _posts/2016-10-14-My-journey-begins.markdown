I’m happy that I finally succeeded to copy a blog from a Demo page. The process was not easy for me with little knowledgement of Ruby,Jekyll,Git and so on.Though many blogs or personal pages have introduced how to make the way here, but they mostly look the same. AS a totally fresh learner, I encountered various problems that they did not mention, guess that’s because they never imaginedthose problems could happen per their perspective, or their were just copying people’s work instead of wordly writing on their own, so I have to figured outthose issues myself. I’m planning to recall my problems and keep the solutions for the record.
