Imagine a indutry dedicated to create raw bamboo based item that we use in common life, tables,chairs,cooking instruments. the corp also utilize modern material to assemble their products, so that some issues that constrains the commercializing of traditional bamboo crafts can be solved. Meanwhile, injecting modern concepts and components into long predescended bamboo art may ignite some flickrs that we never imagined.standardlised components manufacturing and flexible assemble. the corp doesn't only design and produce crafts . they also offer utilities that allows the customers easily design their own products, and leave the constucting job to the corp.

## will it create a `profitable` field?

* `constructing--to be updated,mindmaps etc.`
* `a mindmap to show the whole idea`

## details of the concept-Why bamboo

analizing source of raw bamboo material

### distrbution in the country

### the advantage of fast growing and timberring

* short growth period---enviromental friendly
* timberring---easy to participate/process
* drawback---resource misuitilizing during cutting the leaves and removing the steps.//重重工序的资源消耗(浪费，工序所需投入的人物力）去除竹枝和竹节，以及竹青（皮），竹皮可适当用于色彩搭配，竹枝形状不规则，暂无功用。-->此问题会导致投入/产出比 的上升

* drawback-2:to uitilize the feature of flexible, the workshop need to locate on somewhere id close to the origin place, or the cost of transporting bamboo trunks need to be carefully controled.//可能想多了，运原木的话，因为空心的原因，没有运竹片划算。运竹片可能无法满足形体易塑的要求，还需进一步具体分析

## Why and how to standalize

define common materials or parts, facilite with connvenient Computer Associated Design software.CAD file specify the prcesses how different parts need to be manufactured and materials required (描述部件材质，组合方式，加工工艺等)

## why Flexible

fast and easy to transport/distribute

## compare bamboo plates with woods and other modern material such as plastic and stainless steel.

### bamboo vs. wood

### bamboo vs. steel
stable yet not enough,adding steel may 

### bamboo vs. plastic

white poluttion

### bamboo plates

standardlised components manufacturing and flexible assemble. the corp doesn't only design and produce crafts . they also offer utilities that allows the customers easily design their own products, and leave the constucting job to the corp.

## will this create an profitable industrial?

market research and potenial consuming needs----`NEED MORE DATA TO CONCLUDE!!!`
