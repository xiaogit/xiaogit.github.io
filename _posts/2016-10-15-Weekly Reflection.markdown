Learned about a lot of important 

## Why use Simply Grey?
There are lots of reasons why I think you should use Simply Grey but I will list the main ones that I believe are more of benefit to you, the user.

+	<em>Easy to use and setup</em> - Jekyll has a huge range of documentation to get you started writing posts and the Simply Grey theme makes your blog look beautiful.
+	<em>Easy configuration</em> - I developed this theme in order to be as customisable as possible. If you want to add more links to the navigation bar, all you have to do is edit the _config.yaml file and the `urls` part of it.
+	<em>You can change it</em> - After being released with the MIT license (like Jekyll itself) you are free to change and basically do anything you want to this theme provided you keep the copyright notice in the files and distribute the license with it.
